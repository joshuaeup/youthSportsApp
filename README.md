# The Youth Sports App

# Description

We have decided to develop a sports app that will update and display various aspects of a sports team such as: Announcements, scheduling, a gallery of photos/highlights. These three features are our core functions. We find value in having important dates, times as well as fun things related to your local or your childrenâ€™s sports team being all in one place with real time updates posting to the app so that others can know what is going on if they are not able to make an event or would like to share things with other family members or friends.
